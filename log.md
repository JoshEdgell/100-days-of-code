# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed RoR tutorial about hiding API keys

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow, I'd like to try to use this to hide Google and Dark Sky Keys to start receiving data from them.

### Day 1: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed JWT authorization tutorial in order to use those skills meshed with RoR skills to make backend calls with Ruby.

**Thoughts** Working with Postman was a good refresher - gotta keep with that mindset of making calls during testing in order to make sure it'll work when I build the front end of my weather app.

### Day 2: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started trying to write routes to send data to Google for API response.  Struggled bigly.  I need to restart using Thom's directions tomorrow

**Thoughts** I forget most of the ruby I learned, and what I remember is mostly garbled nonsense.

### Day 3: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I did it!  I was able to send data from Postman into the backend to send to Google - now it's onto writing the front end

**Thoughts** Lisa looked at my like I was crazy when I jumped up and pumped my fists.
