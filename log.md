# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started a Rock, Paper, Scissors app

**Thoughts:** The app can record previous results and plays - work on finishing the "rock" information tomorrow before going on to "paper" and "scissors" information.  Then, start building out the game's strategy.

### Day 1: June 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Rock, Paper, Scissors Game Logic

**Thoughts:** The app can now make predictions of the player's tendencies based on previous actions and win/loss/ties.

### Day 2: June 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Animated Player/Computer Shooting Motions

**Thoughts:** Used CSS and jQuery to animate player and computer fist shooting motions.  Fists disappear after shooting motion.  Tomorrow, I'm going to use the app controller to help add the player and computer plays after the animation runs.

### Day 3: June 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Goodbye, Angular.  Hello, jQuery

**Thoughts:** Realized there's no reason to use AngularJS on this project, so switching to jQuery.  I need to be very careful about how I continue to work on this, because I could very easily build things in the wrong order and make testing next to impossible.

### Day 4: June 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: It *Looks* like a game...

**Thoughts:** Worked on the animation and the logic of the game so that the player can throw rock, paper, or scissors repeatedly.  Now, I've just gotta have the game update the computer image and it'll at least look like a game of rock, paper, scissors (who knows if the logic will work, though?).

### Day 5: June 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: It *Acts* like a game...

**Thoughts:** Finished translating all the AngularJS into jQuery. The game logic is up and looks like it's working.  I need to finish adding tables to completely verify that this is working as it should.  Also, being able to see their results and tendencies could be a useful option for users.

### Day 6: June 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: It *Plays* like a game...

**Thoughts:** Corrected the logic to keep the computer from playing 'rock' to start off with every time.  Styled the shit out of it, and gave it a minimum width to keep from looking all wonky.  Tomorrow, I'm going to add a modal to say "you won/lost/tied" and then start building in the data tables.

### Day 7: June 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Palindrome Number Challenge

**Thoughts:** Completed a code challenge given at Triangle Adult Junior Developers Meetup - "Given a user input of an integer, find the largest palindrome that can be created by multiplying two integers smaller than the input."

### Day 8: June 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Put a Bow on It (and add a description of what it's doing)

**Thoughts:** The Rock, Paper, Scissors game is up and running as a playable (and enjoyable) game.  I would like to come back to it in the near future to give a little explanation of what it's doing and how it works so the user can understand what I've done and why it's important.

### Day 9: June 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Explained and Styled a Recent Code Challenge

**Thoughts:** I wrote an explanation of my solution process for the code challenge I did the other day.  I tried to do the styling in a manner that would lend itself to reuse on other code challenges.

### Day 10: June 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: "Lord Be With You" App (working title)

**Thoughts:** Started working on an app for creating church bulletins - the final intent being that a user will be able to follow along with praise music, announcements, the sermon, etc using an app on their phone.

### Day 11: June 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: "Lord Be With You" App

**Thoughts:** Got all the controllers and models seemingly up and working - I need to switch this over to an angular app to start to test it the way it'll make sense.

### Day 12: June 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: "Lord Be With You" App

**Thoughts:** Started building the angular app - this is going to be a bigger project than I thought.  It shouldn't be tough to complete, but if I want to make the UX as good as it really should be, there are a lot of things that need to get done before I can put a bow on it.
