# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started a Rock, Paper, Scissors app

**Thoughts:** The app can record previous results and plays - work on finishing the "rock" information tomorrow before going on to "paper" and "scissors" information.  Then, start building out the game's strategy.

### Day 1: June 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Rock, Paper, Scissors Game Logic

**Thoughts:** The app can now make predictions of the player's tendencies based on previous actions and win/loss/ties.

### Day 1: June 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Animated Player/Computer Shooting Motions

**Thoughts:** Used CSS and jQuery to animate player and computer fist shooting motions.  Fists disappear after shooting motion.  Tomorrow, I'm going to use the app controller to help add the player and computer plays after the animation runs.
