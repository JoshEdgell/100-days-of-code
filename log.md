# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started a Rock, Paper, Scissors app

**Thoughts:** The app can record previous results and plays - work on finishing the "rock" information tomorrow before going on to "paper" and "scissors" information.  Then, start building out the game's strategy.
