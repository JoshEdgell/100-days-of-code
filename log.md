# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed RoR tutorial about hiding API keys

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow, I'd like to try to use this to hide Google and Dark Sky Keys to start receiving data from them.

### Day 1: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed JWT authorization tutorial in order to use those skills meshed with RoR skills to make backend calls with Ruby.

**Thoughts** Working with Postman was a good refresher - gotta keep with that mindset of making calls during testing in order to make sure it'll work when I build the front end of my weather app.
