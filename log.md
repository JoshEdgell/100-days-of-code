# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed RoR tutorial about hiding API keys

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow, I'd like to try to use this to hide Google and Dark Sky Keys to start receiving data from them.

### Day 1: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed JWT authorization tutorial in order to use those skills meshed with RoR skills to make backend calls with Ruby.

**Thoughts:** Working with Postman was a good refresher - gotta keep with that mindset of making calls during testing in order to make sure it'll work when I build the front end of my weather app.

### Day 2: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started trying to write routes to send data to Google for API response.  Struggled bigly.  I need to restart using Thom's directions tomorrow

**Thoughts:** I forget most of the ruby I learned, and what I remember is mostly garbled nonsense.

### Day 3: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I did it!  I was able to send data from Postman into the backend to send to Google - now it's onto writing the front end

**Thoughts:** Lisa looked at my like I was crazy when I jumped up and pumped my fists.

### Day 4: January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I continued to add to the currentTrip object inside the controller.  I wrote a giant method to find the trip duration only to find that the trip duration was already included in Google's response.

**Thoughts:** A little bit of JavaScript practice is always fun, but I didn't really need it right now and just wanted to continue to push the functionality of the app.

### Day 5: January 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Wrote routes to receive data from Dark Sky Weather and worked on putting responses into the currentTrip object.  Also wrote method to partition trip.

**Thoughts:** The trip partitioning method assumes the trip is in a relatively straight line.  Continue to think about how to find geocoordinates along the actual route (maybe use trip duration information along returned route to be more accurate?)

### Day 6: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started with a problem from Project Euler and then got onto the weather app.  The massive currentTrip object is becoming all-consuming.

**Thoughts:** I'm getting to the point where I need to start considering when a user is leaving (both for the Dark Sky requests and to display the data the user will be shown once all the dust settles from the 15-billion functions that are going to run when the user clicks "get directions."
