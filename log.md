# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started a Rock, Paper, Scissors app

**Thoughts:** The app can record previous results and plays - work on finishing the "rock" information tomorrow before going on to "paper" and "scissors" information.  Then, start building out the game's strategy.

### Day 1: June 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Rock, Paper, Scissors Game Logic

**Thoughts:** The app can now make predictions of the player's tendencies based on previous actions and win/loss/ties.

### Day 2: June 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Animated Player/Computer Shooting Motions

**Thoughts:** Used CSS and jQuery to animate player and computer fist shooting motions.  Fists disappear after shooting motion.  Tomorrow, I'm going to use the app controller to help add the player and computer plays after the animation runs.

### Day 3: June 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Goodbye, Angular.  Hello, jQuery

**Thoughts:** Realized there's no reason to use AngularJS on this project, so switching to jQuery.  I need to be very careful about how I continue to work on this, because I could very easily build things in the wrong order and make testing next to impossible.

### Day 4: June 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: It *Looks* like a game...

**Thoughts:** Worked on the animation and the logic of the game so that the player can throw rock, paper, or scissors repeatedly.  Now, I've just gotta have the game update the computer image and it'll at least look like a game of rock, paper, scissors (who knows if the logic will work, though?).

### Day 4: June 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: It *Acts* like a game...

**Thoughts:** Finished translating all the AngularJS into jQuery. The game logic is up and looks like it's working.  I need to finish adding tables to completely verify that this is working as it should.  Also, being able to see their results and tendencies could be a useful option for users.
